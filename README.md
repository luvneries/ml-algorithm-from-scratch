This repsoitory is designed to get inside ml algorithm instead of just calling APIs.

It helps us to understand algorithms in better way and you can see what happend on backend when you call APIs.
If you go through code once, you will be more comfortable with tutorials and books, which gives fundamentals and theoretical overview of algos.

Note: if you call notebook which refrence modules from another notebook, run refrenced notebook first.

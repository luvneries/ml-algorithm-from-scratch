This repsoitory is designed to get inside ml algorithm instead of just using modules for training, loss and activation functions.

It helps us to understand algorithms in better way and you can see what happens on backend.
Once you go through code, you will be more comfortable with tutorials and books, to understand fundamentals and theoretical overview of algos.

Note: if you call notebook which refrence modules from another notebook, run refrenced notebook first.
